# Portfolio Site

### Description
This is my portfolio site which showcases all of my projects that I've done. It's a continuous work in progress. I plan to add more projects to it when I find the time. Navigating the site is pretty straightforward. The tabs at the top of the page will direct you to each page on my site.

Here is a link to my portfolio site.
